# EAS 1330 Lab 8



This document will show a summary of the steps performed during Lab 8. 



## 1. How the Repository Was Created



The remote repository was created on GitHub:

1.  Logged into GitHub and navigated to New Repository.

2.  Named it `EAS1330_Lab8`.

3.  I made sure that I did not start it with a README so that I could practice adding files later via the command line.

4.  The initial `README.md` was created and committed on the GitHub website before cloning.



## 2. Git Configuration and SSH Setup



Before connecting to GitHub from the Linux environment, I performed the following configuration steps:



### A. Identify Git

This makes my commits with my identity.

```bash

git config --global user.name "Your Name"

git config --global user.email "your_github_email@example.com"
